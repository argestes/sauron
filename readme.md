# Sauron

Sees things

## What
URL parser, fetcher and related automation tools.

## Why
Every intelligent thing needs an eye to see other things. This project is created to serve ongoing AI
research/development for Amerikadaniste.com.

## How
You can either use GUI or API (Json) to interact and enjoy Sauron.

### GUI
High hopes for gui. Currently on roadmap but can be cutout and removed altogether

### API
Sauron provides a Json REST API to interact with your predefined data extraction processes.

## Setup
To use `go get` for this project's dependencies you need to be able to use git on [bitbucket.org](https://bitbucket.org)
repositories since currently this repository and one of his dependencies is hosted there.

To remove annoying `git-credential-manager` popup and use your cute ssh client instead, use this command:
`git config --global url."git@bitbucket.org:".insteadOf "https://bitbucket.org/"`

## Running
Don't know yet
